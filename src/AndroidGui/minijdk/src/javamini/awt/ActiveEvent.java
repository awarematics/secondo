/**
 * An interface for events that know how to dispatch themselves.
 * By implementing this interface an event can be placed upon the event
 * queue and its <code>dispatch()</code> method will be called when the event
 * is dispatched, using the <code>EventDispatchThread</code>.
 * <p>
 * This is a very useful mechanism for avoiding deadlocks. If
 * a thread is executing in a critical section (i.e., it has entered
 * one or more monitors), calling other synchronized code may
 * cause deadlocks. To avoid the potential deadlocks, an
 * <code>ActiveEvent</code> can be created to run the second section of
 * code at later time. If there is contention on the monitor,
 * the second thread will simply block until the first thread
 * has finished its work and exited its monitors.
 * <p>
 * For security reasons, it is often desirable to use an <code>ActiveEvent</code>
 * to avoid calling untrusted code from a critical thread. For
 * instance, peer implementations can use this facility to avoid
 * making calls into user code from a system thread. Doing so avoids
 * potential deadlocks and denial-of-service attacks.
